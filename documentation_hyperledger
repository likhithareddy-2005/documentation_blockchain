Poste  Italiane is one of Italy's oldest organizations. The Poste Italiane website offers financial products, logistics, and insurance services as well as online payments to facilitate track and tracing throughout Italy.
This organization is still standing because it is trying to adapt and learn new technologies.
Hyperledger Fabric
Hyperledger Fabric is an open-source enterprise blockchain platform designed for developing and running decentralized applications (dApps) in a permissioned network. It is one of the projects under the Hyperledger umbrella, hosted by the Linux Foundation. Fabric is specifically designed to address the requirements of business applications, providing a modular and customizable framework for building blockchain-based solutions.
Network: In Hyperledger Fabric, a network consists of multiple organizations (or participants) collaborating to maintain and operate the blockchain. Each organization can have multiple peers and orderers.
Peers: Peers maintain the ledger and smart contracts (chain code) for the network. They participate in endorsing, validating, and committing transactions. Peers can be of two types: endorsing peers, which simulate and endorse transactions, and committing peers, which validate and commit transactions to the ledger.
Channels: Channels enable private and confidential communication within the network. They allow subsets of network participants to create separate transaction flows and maintain a private ledger. This enables secure and selective sharing of information between specific parties.
Chaincode: Chaincode in Hyperledger Fabric represents the smart contracts or business logic written in programming languages such as Go, Node.js, or Java. It defines the rules for validating and updating the ledger state. Chaincode is executed within a secure environment called the "execution sandbox."
Ledger: The ledger is the shared and immutable record of all transactions within the network. Hyperledger Fabric uses a "state-based" or "UTXO-based" ledger, where the current state is derived from a series of transaction outputs.
Consensus: Hyperledger Fabric supports pluggable consensus mechanisms, allowing networks to choose the consensus algorithm that best fits their requirements. By default, it offers the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm, but other algorithms, such as Raft and Kafka, can be used as well.
Membership Services Provider (MSP): MSP manages identities and access control within the network. It authenticates participants, verifies their permissions, and controls their access to resources.
Endorsement Policy: Endorsement policies define the criteria for validating and endorsing transactions. They specify the number and types of endorsements required for a transaction to be valid. This enables flexibility in defining different trust levels within the network.
Fabric Workflow:
Transaction Proposal: A client initiates a transaction by creating a proposal specifying the desired operation and input data. The proposal is sent to endorsing peers.
Endorsement: Endorsing peers simulate and endorse the transaction by executing the chain code in a transaction-specific context. They generate a proposal response that includes the output and endorsement signature.
Transaction Ordering: The endorsed proposals are collected and sent to orderer nodes. The orderer creates a block that includes the endorsed transactions and broadcasts it to the network.
Transaction Validation and Commitment: Committing peers receive the ordered block and validate each transaction. They check the endorsement policy and ensure that the transaction is well-formed and consistent with the current ledger state. Valid transactions are committed to the ledger.
Hyperledger Fabric provides features such as private data collections, rich access control mechanisms, pluggable consensus, and support for modular architecture, making it suitable for various enterprise use cases. It aims to provide scalability, confidentiality, flexibility, and resilience in building decentralized business applications.

Hyperledger Besu
Hyperledger Besu is an open-source Ethereum client developed under the Hyperledger umbrella. It is designed to provide a flexible and enterprise-ready solution for building applications on the Ethereum platform. Besu supports both public Ethereum networks and private permissioned networks, offering features that cater to the needs of businesses and consortia.
Ethereum Client: Besu functions as a client software that connects to the Ethereum network and interacts with the blockchain. It participates in various network activities such as transaction processing, contract deployment, and smart contract execution.
Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM): Besu includes a complete implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The EVM is a runtime environment that executes smart contracts written in Ethereum's Solidity programming language. Besu provides compatibility with the EVM, enabling the execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications.
Privacy and Permissioning: Besu provides privacy features for building private and permissioned networks. It supports private transactions using the Tessera transaction manager, which enables secure and confidential communication between selected participants. Besu also incorporates permissioning mechanisms to control access and ensure that only authorized entities can participate in the network.
Consensus Mechanisms: Besu supports multiple consensus mechanisms, allowing network participants to choose the algorithm that best fits their requirements. It includes consensus algorithms such as Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Authority (PoA), and Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance (IBFT). This flexibility allows for customization and adaptation to various network configurations.
Network Management: Besu offers various features for network management and administration. It includes tools for creating and managing private networks, configuring permissioning rules, managing nodes, monitoring network health, and performing administrative tasks.
Integration with Hyperledger: Besu is integrated with other Hyperledger projects, enabling interoperability and integration with other enterprise blockchain frameworks. It can be combined with Hyperledger Fabric, allowing organizations to leverage the benefits of both platforms in a hybrid architecture.
Besu is designed to provide enterprise-grade features, scalability, and interoperability while maintaining compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem. It aims to address the specific needs of businesses and consortia by offering privacy, permissioning, and robust network management capabilities.
