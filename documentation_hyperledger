Poste  Italiane is one of Italy's oldest organizations. The Poste Italiane website offers financial products, logistics, and insurance services as well as online payments to facilitate track and tracing throughout Italy.
This organization is still standing because it is trying to adapt and learn new technologies.
Hyperledger Fabric is an open-source enterprise blockchain platform designed for developing and running decentralized applications (dApps) in a permissioned network. It is one of the projects under the Hyperledger umbrella, hosted by the Linux Foundation. Fabric is specifically designed to address the requirements of business applications, providing a modular and customizable framework for building blockchain-based solutions.
Network: In Hyperledger Fabric, a network consists of multiple organizations (or participants) collaborating to maintain and operate the blockchain. Each organization can have multiple peers and orderers.
Peers: Peers maintain the ledger and smart contracts (chain code) for the network. They participate in endorsing, validating, and committing transactions. Peers can be of two types: endorsing peers, which simulate and endorse transactions, and committing peers, which validate and commit transactions to the ledger.
Channels: Channels enable private and confidential communication within the network. They allow subsets of network participants to create separate transaction flows and maintain a private ledger. This enables secure and selective sharing of information between specific parties.
Chaincode: Chaincode in Hyperledger Fabric represents the smart contracts or business logic written in programming languages such as Go, Node.js, or Java. It defines the rules for validating and updating the ledger state. Chaincode is executed within a secure environment called the "execution sandbox."
Ledger: The ledger is the shared and immutable record of all transactions within the network. Hyperledger Fabric uses a "state-based" or "UTXO-based" ledger, where the current state is derived from a series of transaction outputs.
Consensus: Hyperledger Fabric supports pluggable consensus mechanisms, allowing networks to choose the consensus algorithm that best fits their requirements. By default, it offers the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm, but other algorithms, such as Raft and Kafka, can be used as well.
Membership Services Provider (MSP): MSP manages identities and access control within the network. It authenticates participants, verifies their permissions, and controls their access to resources.
Endorsement Policy: Endorsement policies define the criteria for validating and endorsing transactions. They specify the number and types of endorsements required for a transaction to be valid. This enables flexibility in defining different trust levels within the network.

Fabric Workflow:
Transaction Proposal: A client initiates a transaction by creating a proposal specifying the desired operation and input data. The proposal is sent to endorsing peers.
Endorsement: Endorsing peers simulate and endorse the transaction by executing the chain code in a transaction-specific context. They generate a proposal response that includes the output and endorsement signature.
Transaction Ordering: The endorsed proposals are collected and sent to orderer nodes. The orderer creates a block that includes the endorsed transactions and broadcasts it to the network.
Transaction Validation and Commitment: Committing peers receive the ordered block and validate each transaction. They check the endorsement policy and ensure that the transaction is well-formed and consistent with the current ledger state. Valid transactions are committed to the ledger.
Hyperledger Fabric provides features such as private data collections, rich access control mechanisms, pluggable consensus, and support for modular architecture, making it suitable for various enterprise use cases. It aims to provide scalability, confidentiality, flexibility, and resilience in building decentralized business applications.
